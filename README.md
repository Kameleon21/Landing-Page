# Landing-Page
With this website I learned a lot about layout and how to position certain items.
The use of div's was a very useful type but also how to create a modern looking website.
It took me some time as well as research online on how to get my website to look the way it does
I see as a template for any photographers wanting to show or have work/personal website
